/**
 * Space
 * =====
 *
 * The `com.lhkbob.imaje.color.space` package contains many child packages describing various groups
 * or families of color spaces, ranging from the common RGB representations, derived spaces like HSV
 * or YUV, perceptual spaces like CIELAB, or more low-level spaces like XYZ and full-spectrum
 * colors.
 *
 * Additionally, it provides a set of spaces for dealing with different depth encodings, and a
 * common vector space implementation, {@link com.lhkbob.imaje.color.space.GenericVectorSpace} that
 * can be easily used for custom vector types that are unique, don't represent colors, and don't
 * require the flexibility that is used for {@link com.lhkbob.imaje.color.Depth} values.
